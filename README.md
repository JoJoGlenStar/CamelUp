# CamelUp
Replication of one of my favorite board games, Camel Up

I was inpired to code this game during the first time I ever played it. 
Once I saw that the stacking mechanic worked the same as the stack data structure I got really excited.
I initially created a console version in C++ but switched to JavaScript because I could create a GUI with HTML/CSS.
All the imagry was taken directly from the game I own, and I did my best to edit and clean it up.

Code still needs many updates but the game currently functions start to finish.
